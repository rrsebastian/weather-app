# About this project

This weather app uses 2 different APIs to determain the current weather in the City of choice, and the other API is to determain the current world time for the location of the City that is searched, 
it stores the City that is searched in localstorage and I implemented the choice of dark mode or light mode for the user to choose from which also gets stored in localstorage.
